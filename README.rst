This repository contains an integration between OS2MO and
OS2Rollekataloget. It contains a single Python package, and installing
this Python package will create an executable called
``OS2Rollekataloget_integration``. This executable will export the whole
organization from OS2MO, providing the correct user IDs for integration
with the AD federation.
